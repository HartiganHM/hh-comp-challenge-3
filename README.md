Static Composition #3 (Turing: Mod 1)

**Project Scope**

The aim of this project was to recreate a static composition provided through our instructor with no native files at our disposal. We were to maintain the overall layout, but had creative liberties in terms of copy, images, icons, and color, so long as we made sure to use a complimentary color theme. The challenge required us to make the site responsive as well, with the layout adapting to various screen sizes. However, a responsive layout composition was not provided for us, only a desktop layout, and we were assumed to use our best judgement in regards to responsiveness. The first image below is the original layout, followed by my re-interpritation.

My version of the page kept a majority of the overall content and copy in the interest of matching the layout of the static comp as closely as possible. With that in mind, the colors and layout are essentially the same, with minor variences that were up to interpretation, such as hover states, active states, and icons. With the amount of information on the page, I thought it best to get the small layout intricacies working before radically changing the copy/content/color-scheme, a goal I think I accomplished and am very proud of. 

With this in mind, however, I didn't get to some of the more complex CSS animations that I would have liked and had to resort to more static CSS designs or images. Additionally, while the project has fun elements in it (ie relating to my dog, Torin) I would like to revisit this project and make it my own, switching up the subject matter and adjusting the copy and color palette accordingly.

Overally, I am very pleased with what I accomplished. While all of the spacing and padding isn't necessarily perfect, I think it is increbily close to being so. With some minor adjustments, I think I could make it a seamless layout. I am also very proud of the responsive features of this website. Attacking each section of the static comp one at a time, I was able to focus on the individual aspects of that area and then marry it into what I had already created. While the responsive, again, isn't perfect, I think there are some very clean and intuitive solutions to the challenge we were presented with making the static comp a responsive webpage.
